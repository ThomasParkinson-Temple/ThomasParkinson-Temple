This map was from our 4th lab where we had to figure out the relationship between police
districts, homicides, and Airbnbs in Chicago. To do this we used the new skills
learned that week (Join, Summarize, and Density Calculation). I used
Summarize to gather the needed information from the Airbnb and Crime data
which I was then able to join into the police districts data. After which I was
able to calculate the density of homicides and Airbnb Reviews for each police
district

This was the map for the 3rd Mastery Assignment. For this assignment we had to create a map with data from the University of Michigan on which nieghborhooods of Flint were  most affected by toxic drinking water. To accomplish this we used the buffer and intersect functions that we had learned the previous week. Using these functions we were able to gather the areas of Flint that met the criteria set in assingment for possible water toxicity.

<img src="Miami%20Vacant%20Houses%20Map.png" alt="Miami Vacant Houses Map">

In this assignment we had to map the population density of Miami from
the census tract level and from the block level. We also had to map occupied
and vacant housing units in Miami at the census tract level. This assignment
is a good example of showing the ecological fallacy, what may be true at a
higher level like a census tract is not necessarily true at the lower level like the
block, in terms of density. The population density of a larger unit like a census
tract doesn’t mean that the smaller units like the blocks that make it up will
share this density. Some blocks may be less dense, and some may be denser.
This also leads to MAUP, for example one extremely dense block may create a
bias that its census tract is denser than it really is. Obviously, there are times
when it is important to flatten out the data and to look at it from the
perspective of a larger unit such as a census tract. But it is important to be
aware of these fallacies and biases especially when this data is affecting
important policies.
