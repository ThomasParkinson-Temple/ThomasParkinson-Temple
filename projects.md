  🌐 **Below are some of my favorite maps from this semester!** 🗺️

This map was from our 4th lab where we had to figure out the relationship between police
districts, homicides, and Airbnbs in Chicago. To do this we used the new skills
learned that week (Join, Summarize, and Density Calculation). I used
Summarize to gather the needed information from the Airbnb and Crime data
which I was then able to join into the police districts data. After which I was
able to calculate the density of homicides and Airbnb Reviews for each police
district
