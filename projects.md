  🌐 **Below are some of my favorite maps from this semester!** 🗺️

<img src="Airbnb%20Density%20Map.png" alt="Airbnb Density Map">
This map was from our 4th lab where we had to figure out the relationship between police
districts, homicides, and Airbnbs in Chicago. To do this we used the new skills
learned that week (Join, Summarize, and Density Calculation). I used
Summarize to gather the needed information from the Airbnb and Crime data
which I was then able to join into the police districts data. After which I was
able to calculate the density of homicides and Airbnb Reviews for each police
district

This was the map for the 3rd Mastery Assignment. For this assignment we had to create a map with data from the University of Michigan on which nieghborhooods of Flint were  most affected by toxic drinking water. To accomplish this we used the buffer and intersect functions that we had learned the previous week. Using these functions we were able to gather the areas of Flint that met the criteria set in assingment for possible water toxicity.
